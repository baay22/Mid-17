            <section>
                <p>As someone who has been an active part of the world of digital marketing and wealth management and financial planning for the last decade and a half, it’s easy to see why staying current on all the latest tips, tricks, best practices and trends in the industry is important. After all, how can you advise your own clients on the best course of action to take if you’re not actually sure what it is yourself?</p>
                <p>But at the same time, I also understand how difficult it is to read a wide range of different publications in the fast-paced world we’re now living in. Simply educating yourself on financial planning technology can quickly become a full-time job – which is problematic, since you probably already have at least one of those monopolizing your time.</p>
                <p>With so many print and online publications out there, not to mention blogs, how do you know what to focus your time on? How do you even know where to begin?</p>
                <p>Actually, we have a few ideas about that, all of which we’d love to share with you.</p>
                <p>We’ve recently compiled a handy list of all the top financial advisor and wealth management blogs out there, as per traffic estimates from <a href="https://www.semrush.com/"> SEMRUSH</a>. Many of these are written by registered investment advisors and similar professionals and all of them bring something unique to the table that is certainly worth a closer look.</p>
                <p>In this article, we are reviewing the first 10, but we took the time and created an easy download if you want to take the longer list with you.</p>

                <h2>Above the Market</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>If you make it a priority to follow just one financial advisor or wealth management blog, do yourself a favor and make sure it’s this one.</p>
                <p><a href="https://rpseawright.wordpress.com/"> Above the Market</a> is operated by Robert P. Seawright – the Chief Investment and Information Officer for Madison Avenue Securities, LLC. To give Mr. Seawright’s credibility a bit of context, in September of 2014 the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/"> Wall Street Journal</a> published a list of just fifteen “smart people for investors to follow.” Not only was Seawright on the list, but he was in good company – people like Warren Buffet, William Bernstein and Howard Marks were there, too.</p>
                <p>All told, <u>Above the Market</u> has received recognition from just about every media source you can think of and in 2014 it was actually ranked in the top ten advisor blogs in the entire country based on readership and influence.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Avondale Asset Management Blog</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>As the name suggests, this blog is owned and operated by <a href="https://skrisiloff.tumblr.com/"> Avondale Asset Management</a> – an investment firm based in beautiful Los Angeles, California. That organization’s Chief Investment Officer is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottkrisiloff/"> Scott Krisiloff</a> – someone who has been at the forefront of many different trends over the years and who is absolutely worth paying attention to.</p>
                <p>Krisiloff writes a lot of the pieces for the blog (along with his fellow team members) and if there’s something lurking on the horizon that you or your own clients absolutely need to know about, you can rest assured that you’ll probably hear it from Scott first.</p>

                <h2>Good Financial Cents</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><a href="https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/blog/"> Good Financial Cents</a> is an advisor and wealth management blog with a simple message that most people can get behind: it’s time to step up and take control of YOUR money, no matter what. The folks at <u>Good Financial Cents</u> believe that it’s never too late to get started securing a better financial future for you and your loved ones and over the years they’ve written about a wide range of different topics like the power of Roth IRAs and more.</p>
                <p>In 2013, they even helped launch The Debt Movement – where they’re currently helping to motivate people across the country to pay off $10 million of combined debt. So to say that <u>Good Financial Cents</u> is influential is probably a bit of an understatement.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><a href="https://ritholtz.com/"> The Big Picture</a> is a worthy addition to this list because it generates between one and two million page views every single month. Over its history it has amassed an incredible 150 million visitors, easily making it one of the most heavily trafficked financial advisor and wealth management blogs on the Internet.</p>
                <p>The <u>Big Picture</u> is the product of Ritzholtz Wealth Management, LLC and their co-founder, chairman and Chief Investment Officer Barry L. Ritholtz. He’s long been fascinated by the ways that behavioral economics and data analysis impact investors and it’s safe to say that this blog is well worth keeping an eye on.</p>

                <h2>Nerd’s Eye View</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><a href="https://www.kitces.com/"> Nerd’s Eye</a> View is a great financial advisor blog because it takes inherently complicated financial topics and breaks them down in a way that is easy – and dare we say it, fun – for literally anyone to follow.</p>
                <p>The blog’s owner and operator, Michael Kitces, realized long ago that he had a special gift – one that allowed him to gather scattered information and bring it all together in an organized way that absolutely anyone could act upon. With that in mind, <u>Nerd’s Eye</u> View was born – and it’s an invaluable wealth of information (no pun intended) on all things financial planning.</p>

                <h2>The Reformed Broker</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/"> The Reformed Broker</a> first began life in 2008 and since those modest days, it has become one of the most widely read financial advisor blogs operating anywhere on the Internet today. Not only does the blog cover the markets, politics, economics, the media, culture and finance, but it does so with a trademark blend of statistics, satire, anecdotes and pop culture references.</p>
                <p>Any technique that Joshua M. Brown (also of Ritzholtz Wealth Management) needs to use to get his point across is one he’s more than willing to capitalize on, much to the benefit of his many, many readers across the country.</p>

                <h2>Mauldin Economics</h2>

                <h2>Wealth Pilgrim</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><a href="https://wealthpilgrim.com/"> Wealth Pilgrim</a> is a site founded and operated by Neal Frankle, a certified financial planner with more than 25 years of rock solid experience in the industry. He began the blog under a straightforward premise: he wanted people to have NO money worries, no matter what.</p>
                <p>He does this by not only helping people really understand how investments work, but also by teaching them to create the retirement income they’ll need BEFORE the big day arrives. All told, <u>Wealth Pilgrim</u> has amassed a community of more than 10,000 people during its history and that shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>

                <h2>The Irrelevant Investor</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>As part of his position as the Director of Research at a major wealth management firm, it is literally Michael Batnick’s job to read as many publications as he can and stay up-to-date on all of the latest trends in the industry. But rather than let that information exist exclusively inside his own head, he’s decided to share it with the world – and that is precisely what <a href="https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/"> The Irrelevant Investor</a> is all about.</p>
                <p>Michael is also an expert at developing and implementing risk management and portfolio strategies for the clients at his firm, which is yet another topic that he covers in great detail on the blog.</p>

                <h2>Alpha Architect Blog</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>The team behind the <a href="https://alphaarchitect.com/blog/"> Alpha Architect</a> blog understand that at the end of the day, the most important tool that investors have is and will always be education. That’s also what the blog wants to share – it tries to empower investors through education, all in the name of creating a far more sustainable generation of investors moving forward.</p>
                <p>The <u>Alpha Architect</u> blog is notable because their core values are built on not only transparency, but also evidence-based investing and a systematic level of decision-making that few others can match.</p>

            <section>
                <p><a href="https://www.pragcap.com/"> Pragmatic Capitalism</a> was founded in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008 and it’s easy to see how that timing has influenced literally everything about it, including the name.</p>
                <p>All told, the blog and its founder Cullen Roche want to cut through all the noise – providing answers to the toughest questions in finance and economics WITHOUT all of the hassles that normally go with it. Not only is the blog an invaluable resource for better understanding the world of investment, but it’s also a healthy forum for spirited discourse and debate, too.</p>
